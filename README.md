# Matrix Episode Bot

A bot for sending links to episodes mentioned in a chat room.

## Setup

Copy `sample.config.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit to your needs.

## Usage

Users should be able to get a link to browse episodes with `!episodes list`.
This text is configurable in `config.yaml`.

Otherwise any time an episode title is mentioned in a message, or a
season/episode combo in the form of `S02E05` (for Season 2, Episode 5 of the
show), then the bot will post the name of an episode and a link to watch it.
